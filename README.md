Aim: An introduction to the basic datatypes in C++
Tools: VS Code

Theory:

In C++, basic data types (also called primitive or fundamental data types) are the building blocks of data manipulation. These types are predefined by the language and serve as the foundation for creating variables and performing operations.

Type	               Description	                         Example Values
int	            Integer numbers (no decimal)	               -3, 0, 42
float	        Floating-point numbers (single precision)	    3.14, -0.001
double	        Floating-point (double precision)	          2.71828, -100.0
char	             Single character	                        'a', 'Z', '7'
bool	            Boolean values	                           true, false
void	        No value (used for functions with no return)	void function()


Conclusion:
Understanding the basic data types in C++ is essential for writing efficient, accurate, and optimized programs. These types—such as int, float, char, bool, and void—form the foundation upon which all variables and data structures are built.

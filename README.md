Aim: An introduction to the basic datatypes in C++
Tools: VS Code

Theory:

In C++, basic data types (also called primitive or fundamental data types) are the building blocks of data manipulation. These types are predefined by the language and serve as the foundation for creating variables and performing operations.

| Type     | Description                      | Example             |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `int`    | Integer values                   | `int x = 5;`        |
| `float`  | Floating point (decimal numbers) | `float y = 5.6f;`   |
| `double` | Double-precision floating point  | `double z = 6.28;`  |
| `char`   | Single character                 | `char ch = 'A';`    |
| `bool`   | Boolean (true/false)             | `bool flag = true;` |
| `void`   | No value (used for functions)    | `void func();`      |

| Type     | Typical Size | Range (on 32-bit systems)       |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `char`   | 1 byte       | -128 to 127                     |
| `int`    | 4 bytes      | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| `float`  | 4 bytes      | ±3.4e−38 to ±3.4e+38            |
| `double` | 8 bytes      | ±1.7e−308 to ±1.7e+308          |
| `bool`   | 1 byte       | `true` (1) or `false` (0)       |



Conclusion:
Understanding the basic data types in C++ is essential for writing efficient, accurate, and optimized programs. These types—such as int, float, char, bool, and void—form the foundation upon which all variables and data structures are built.
